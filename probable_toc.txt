EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
Context and description of the Disability Identification Mechanism 
The Disability Identification Mechanism (DIM) in Cambodia serves as part of the national social 
protection system designed to uphold the rights of persons with disabilities and promote their inclusion 
in society. Its inception traces back to the adoption of the Law on the Protection and Promotion of the 
Rights of Persons with Disabilities in 2009, followed by Cambodia's ratification of the Convention on the 
Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD) in 2012. These legislative frameworks underscore Cambodia's 
dedication to safeguarding the rights of persons with disabilities. 
To translate these commitments into action, Cambodia introduced the Guideline on Social- and Rights-
Based Disability Identification in August 2020,1 under the purview of the Ministry of Social Affairs, 
Veterans and Youth Rehabilitation (MoSVY). This guideline established a standardized procedure for 
identifying persons with disabilities. Central to this process is the Disability Management Information 
System (DMIS), a centralized database tasked with collecting and storing disability-related data. 
 
The MoSVY issues disability cards based on information in the DMIS used to identify individuals as 
persons with disabilities. Once identified and found to meet the eligibility criteria, these individuals can 
access various social protection benefits and services provided by the Royal Government of Cambodia 
(RGC) and its partners. The institutionalization of this mechanism was further solidified by the RGC Sub-
decree on Identification of Disabilities by Social Model and Basic Rights adopted in July 2023. 
 
The DIM operates through a dynamic multi-stakeholder approach, involving various government 
ministries, agencies and partners to ensure comprehensive implementation. MoSVY assumes a central 
role in coordinating and executing DIM initiatives, underscoring its commitment to disability inclusion 
and social protection. 
 
Evaluation purpose, objectives and audience 
The General Secretariat for the National Social Protection Council (GS-NSPC), with support from MoSVY 
and the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) conducted a process evaluation of the DIM. The 
primary aim of this evaluation was to facilitate learning and improvement within the disability 
identification process. 
The process evaluation concentrated on analysing the design and implementation of the DIM, with 
particular emphasis on assessing its effectiveness, efficiency and accuracy. Key objectives included 
evaluating the robustness of the operational framework and identifying barriers that impede the 
identification process. 
The evaluation criteria utilized standards from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and 
Development (OECD) and the Disability Action Council (DAC), which were adapted to align with the 
specific objectives of the process evaluation. Relevance, effectiveness, efficiency, sustainability and 
coherence were among the criteria considered, with a focused attention on cross-cutting themes such 
as equity, gender equality and human rights.

Audience for the evaluation 
The primary audience and intended users of the evaluation findings comprise: 
1. GS-NSPC: The GS-NSPC will utilize the findings to enhance coordination efforts and improve 
overall effectiveness of the identification mechanism. 
2. MoSVY: Being the lead implementing ministry, MoSVY will refine its strategies and address 
challenges based on the evaluation results, thereby enhancing its role in disability inclusion 
initiatives. 
3. UNICEF Cambodia: As the commissioned United Nations agency, UNICEF Cambodia will enhance 
its support for the DIM, including financial and technical support, as well as capacity building for 
disability focal points.  
4.  Other United Nations agencies: Sister agencies will strengthen their support for the DIM and 
enhance their contributions to disability inclusion initiatives in Cambodia. 
5. Implementing line ministries: This includes the Ministry of Interior (MoI), the Ministry of 
Planning (MoP), the Ministry of Health (MoH), the Council for the Development of Cambodia, 
and the DAC. They will receive recommendations aimed at improving their roles in the disability 
identification process, fostering greater effectiveness and efficiency. 
Secondary audiences include development partners and donors operating in disability inclusion and 
social protection sectors. They will leverage the findings to inform their strategies and investments in 
Cambodia and beyond, thereby contributing to broader efforts towards disability inclusion and social 
protection. 
Evaluation methodology 
The evaluation employed a mixed-methods approach, combining document review, qualitative data 
collection and secondary data analysis to comprehensively assess Cambodia's Social- and Rights-Based 
DIM. The methodology aimed to generate evidence-based recommendations for enhancing the 
disability identification process. 
A comprehensive review of pertinent documents, including laws, guidelines, reports and protocols, 
provided insights into the background, objectives and implementation framework of the DIM. Key 
documents comprised national and international policy documents on disability rights, DIM guidelines 
and reports related to social protection efforts. 
Secondary quantitative data, drawn from the DMIS database, underwent analysis to discern trends and 
patterns in DIM implementation. These data were cross-referenced with primary qualitative data to 
gauge the extent of the disability identification process. 
Primary qualitative data were acquired through key informant interviews (KIIs), focus group discussions 
(FGDs), case studies and online survey questionnaires sent to Provincial Departments of Social Affairs, 
Veterans and Youth Rehabilitation (PDoSVYs). KIIs and FGDs delved into stakeholders' perspectives on 
DIM implementation and areas for improvement, while case studies provided detailed insights into 
specific challenges faced by individuals with disabilities. Consultations with persons with disabilities, 
families, caregivers and key stakeholders ensured inclusivity and captured diverse perspectives in the 
evaluation process. Site visits observed disability identification processes firsthand, facilitating a 
nuanced understanding of DIM implementation on the ground. 
Semi-structured tools for KIIs and FGDs were devised, encompassing evaluation questions delineated in 
the evaluation matrix. Ethical data collection was ensured through an ethical review process including 
informed consent forms, and data collection tools were translated into Khmer for accessibility. A
