      "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY \n",
      "\n",
      "Context and description of the Disability Identification Mechanism \n",
      "\n",
      "The Disability Identification Mechanism (DIM) in Cambodia serves as part of the national social \n",
      "protection system designed to uphold the rights of persons with disabilities and promote their inclusion \n",
      "in society. Its inception traces back to the adoption of the Law on the Protection and Promotion of the \n",
      "Rights of Persons with Disabilities in 2009, followed by Cambodia's ratification of the Convention on the \n",
      "Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD) in 2012. These legislative frameworks underscore Cambodia's \n",
      "dedication to safeguarding the rights of persons with disabilities. \n",
      "\n",
      "To translate these commitments into action, Cambodia introduced the Guideline on Social- and Rights-\n",
      "Based Disability Identification in August 2020,1 under the purview of the Ministry of Social Affairs, \n",
      "Veterans and Youth Rehabilitation (MoSVY). This guideline established a standardized procedure for \n",
      "identifying persons with disabilities. Central to this process is the Disability Management Information \n",
      "System (DMIS), a centralized database tasked with collecting and storing disability-related data. \n",
      " \n",
      "The MoSVY issues disability cards based on information in the DMIS used to identify individuals as \n",
      "persons with disabilities. Once identified and found to meet the eligibility criteria, these individuals can \n",
      "access various social protection benefits and services provided by the Royal Government of Cambodia \n",
      "(RGC) and its partners. The institutionalization of this mechanism was further solidified by the RGC Sub-\n",
      "decree on Identification of Disabilities by Social Model and Basic Rights adopted in July 2023. \n",
      " \n",
      "The DIM operates through a dynamic multi-stakeholder approach, involving various government \n",
      "ministries, agencies and partners to ensure comprehensive implementation. MoSVY assumes a central \n",
      "role in coordinating and executing DIM initiatives, underscoring its commitment to disability inclusion \n",
      "and social protection. \n",
      "\n",
      " \n",
      "Evaluation purpose, objectives and audience \n",
      "\n",
      "The General Secretariat for the National Social Protection Council (GS-NSPC), with support from MoSVY \n",
      "and the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) conducted a process evaluation of the DIM. The \n",
      "primary aim of this evaluation was to facilitate learning and improvement within the disability \n",
      "identification process. \n",
      "\n",
      "The process evaluation concentrated on analysing the design and implementation of the DIM, with \n",
      "particular emphasis on assessing its effectiveness, efficiency and accuracy. Key objectives included \n",
      "evaluating the robustness of the operational framework and identifying barriers that impede the \n",
      "identification process. \n",
      "\n",
      "The evaluation criteria utilized standards from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and \n",
      "Development (OECD) and the Disability Action Council (DAC), which were adapted to align with the \n",
      "specific objectives of the process evaluation. Relevance, effectiveness, efficiency, sustainability and \n",
      "coherence were among the criteria considered, with a focused attention on cross-cutting themes such \n",
      "as equity, gender equality and human rights. \n",

      "and above in Cambodia were persons with disabilities who were facing challenges in performing basic \n",
      "functions. According to the report from MoSVY on Social- and Rights-Based Disability Identification for \n",
      "2022, a total of 230,588 persons with disabilities were identified, constituting 1.36 per cent of the \n",
      "Cambodian population of approximately 16,967,399.4 \n",
      "\n",
      "The age distribution reveals that 9.32 per cent of the population aged 80 years and above are registered \n",
      "as persons with disabilities, followed by 2.15 per cent of those aged 50–80, and 0.54 per cent of those \n",
      "aged 20–50. Concerning disability severity, 27.9 per cent are classified as having severe disabilities, 20.7 \n",
      "per cent as having moderate disabilities, and 51.4 per cent as having mild disabilities. In terms of \n",
      "disability type, 51.5 per cent have physical disabilities, 29.7 per cent have sensory disabilities, 7.7 per \n",
      "cent have intellectual disabilities, 4.1 per cent have mental disabilities, and 7.0 per cent have other \n",

      "54.5 per cent have mild disabilities compared to 47.8 per cent for women. The main causes of disability \n",
      "include illness (38.8 per cent), congenital disability (26.7 per cent), disability resulting from traffic \n",
      "accidents (8.1 per cent), disability due to war/landmine/UXO (12.2 per cent), and other causes (14.3 per \n",

      "\n",
      "Regarding social participation and support needs, 57.3 per cent of persons with disabilities aged 8 years \n",
      "and above encounter difficulties, require support or are unable to participate in community activities.  \n",
      "Children with disabilities and individuals aged 75 years and above with disabilities require more \n",

      "25.6 per cent of all persons with disabilities possess an equity card, with 10.0 per cent classified as \n",
      "IDPoor 1 (very poor) and 15.6 per cent as IDPoor 2 (poor). There are more women with disabilities in \n",
      "IDPoor families than men. The number of registered persons with disabilities is highest in Svay Rieng \n",

      "\n",
      "Despite this situation, Cambodia has demonstrated a robust commitment to advancing disability rights. \n",
      "The country's ratification of the CRPD and its Optional Protocol, along with its endorsement of the \n",
      "Marrakesh Treaty, underscores its dedication to upholding the rights of persons with disabilities on an \n",

      "At the operational level, the disability identification process is carried out within communes, with \n",

      "2. CONTEXT AND DESCRIPTION OF THE DIM \n",
      "\n",
      "In Cambodia, disability inclusion has been a pressing issue, with persons with disabilities historically \n",
      "facing societal stigma and discrimination, hindering their access to education, employment, health care \n",
      "and essential services. Concerted efforts by the RGC, non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and \n",
      "international agencies, however, have aimed to address these challenges and promote disability rights \n",
      "and inclusion. \n",
      "\n",
      "A significant milestone was the adoption of the Law on the Protection and Promotion of the Rights of \n",
      "Persons with Disabilities in 2009, signaling the RGC's commitment to ensuring equal opportunities, \n",
      "access to services and protection against discrimination for persons with disabilities. Additionally, \n",
      "organizations like the Cambodian Disabled People's Organization (CDPO) have played crucial roles in \n",
      "advocating for disability rights and providing essential support services. These collective efforts have \n",
      "resulted in tangible improvements in accessibility, education, vocational training and employment \n",
      "opportunities for persons with disabilities throughout Cambodia. \n",
      "\n",
      "2.1. Key stakeholders involved in disability inclusion   \n",
      "\n",
      "In Cambodia, disability inclusion coordination involves a diverse range of stakeholders, each playing a \n",
      "crucial role in shaping policies, implementing initiatives and advocating for the rights of persons with \n",
      "disabilities. \n",
      "\n",
      "At the national level, the DAC serves as the primary coordination body, wielding significant influence, \n",
      "resources and staffing dedicated to addressing disability issues. OPDs hold permanent seats within the \n",
      "DAC, granting them substantial influence over decision-making processes at both national and \n",
      "subnational levels. While the DAC leads the development of national strategies and action plans as well \n",
      "as the implementation of the CRPD and related laws, the GS-NSPC coordinates stakeholders and \n",
      "provides direction to develop social assistance systems for persons with disabilities. \n",
      "\n",
      "Key government entities, such as MoSVY and its Department of Welfare of Persons with Disabilities \n",
      "(DWPD), lead efforts to develop policies and programmes aimed at social assistance and security for \n",
      "persons with disabilities.  \n",
      "\n",
      "The Disability Rights Administration (DRA), a division within the DWPD, plays a pivotal role in monitoring \n",
      "and promoting the implementation of the Disability Law. Its responsibilities include conducting \n",
      "inspections, providing legal consultations, mediating conflicts and lodging complaints in cases of law \n",
      "violations. \n",
      "\n",
      "Contributing to disability inclusion efforts is the CDPO, serving as a vital channel for promoting disability \n",
      "rights and fostering inclusion. With a widespread network spanning all provinces and engaging in various \n",
      "forums, the CDPO actively participates in policy development, strategic planning and advocacy. Strategic \n",
      "partnerships with United Nations agencies enhance the CDPO's capacity to address emerging issues and \n",
      "advocate for disability rights. \n",
      "\n",
      "The United Nations system collaborates with persons with disabilities and their representative \n",
      "organizations to drive disability-inclusive programmes and projects. Initiatives like the Disability Rights \n",
      "Initiative Cambodia, jointly implemented starting in 2013 by the United Nations Development \n",
      "Programme (UNDP), UNICEF, the United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of \n",

      "Women (UN Women), the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) \n",
      "and the World Health Organization (WHO), demonstrated the commitment to empowering persons with \n",
      "disabilities. Lastly, committed development partners such as the Australian Department of Foreign \n",
      "Affairs and Trade (DFAT), Research Triangle Institute International (RTI) and the EU provide sustained \n",
      "support to disability initiatives through long-standing partnerships and investments in Cambodia. \n",
      "Together, these stakeholders form a dynamic ecosystem of collaboration, advocacy and action, working \n",
      "tirelessly to advance disability inclusion in Cambodia.7  \n",
      "\n",
      "2.2. Inclusive service delivery  \n",
      "\n",
      "In Cambodia, strides have been taken to foster inclusive service delivery across various sectors, with a \n",
      "focus on social protection, health, education and employment. Challenges persist, however, in fully \n",
      "realizing inclusivity goals outlined in existing policies and programmes. \n",
      "\n",
      "In the social protection sector, significant gaps remain, particularly in the coverage and accessibility of \n",
      "social assistance programmes for vulnerable groups, including persons with disabilities. While efforts \n",
      "have been made to implement initiatives like cash transfer programmes and social security schemes, \n",
      "some vulnerable groups, including persons with disabilities, are often left out of these vital support \n",
      "systems. \n",
      "\n",
      "2.3. Disability identification and referral services \n",
      "\n",
      "In Cambodia, the establishment of the Council for Disability Classification marked a significant step \n",
      "towards enhancing disability identification and referral services. The primary objective of the council is \n",
      "to evaluate persons with disabilities, determining the nature and severity of their condition, while also \n",
      "streamlining data collection processes for more effective policy formulation and implementation under \n",
      "the Disability Law.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Central to this initiative is the provision of disability cards to eligible persons with disabilities, granting \n",
      "them access to essential services such as free health care. Despite these efforts, however, numerous \n",
      "barriers persist, hindering the accessibility of disability identification services. Foremost among these \n",
      "challenges is the accessibility of assessment centres, which are predominantly located in commune \n",
      "offices. Some persons with disabilities, particularly those with specific types of disabilities, face \n",
      "significant challenges in traveling to these centers, often due to distance and associated costs.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Moreover, a lack of awareness about the identification process further compounds these difficulties, \n",
      "leaving individuals uninformed about their rights and available support services. \n",
      "\n",
      "2.4. Policy context \n",
      "\n",
      "In Cambodia, the pursuit of disability inclusion and rights protection is anchored in the country's robust \n",
      "policy framework, epitomized by the Social- and Rights-Based DIM. This mechanism finds its roots in \n",
      "Cambodia's overarching disability policy framework, characterized by key documents such as the NDSP \n",
      "and the NSPPF 2016–2025.8 Together, these policy documents provide a comprehensive roadmap for \n",

      "\n",

      "NDSP and NSPPF, the DIM underscores Cambodia's unwavering commitment to advancing the rights \n",

      "\n",
      "Firstly, the commune administration initiates the identification process by disseminating information \n",
      "about the DIM to village chiefs and community members, sharing details about the sub-decree and \n",
      "relevant information related to persons with disabilities. This aims to raise awareness and encourage \n",
      "identification within the villages. Additionally, the commune informs persons with disabilities about the \n",

      "family residency documents. \n",
      "\n",
      "Secondly, the commune administration schedules interviews with persons with disabilities, either at \n",
      "assessment centres in the commune buildings, at the house of the village chief or directly at the homes \n",
      "of persons with disabilities who are unable to travel due to age or the severity of their disability. This \n",
      "ensures that interviews are inclusive and do not discriminate based on socio-economic status. Generally, \n",
      "the disability focal point contacts persons with disabilities a day or two in advance to confirm the \n",
      "interview schedule and provide them with sufficient time to prepare supporting documents. \n",
      "\n",
      "During the interviews, commune officers collect data from persons with disabilities – including personal \n",
